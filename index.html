  <h3 class="main">Introduction and Motivation</h3>
  <p>The March Madness Tournament is the biggest college basketball tournament in America.
     Millions of people fill out brackets in hopes of correctly predicting the tournament and winning competitions and bets.
     However, in all the years the tournament has occurred, not a single person has created the perfect bracket yet.</p>
  <p>Being able to predict a tournament correctly would be revolutionary in the world of sports betting.
    It would also allow insight in basketball analysis. If some stats are more important than others and lead to more wins on average,
    coaches would know what the best way is to practice. Basketball is an extremely complicated sport where all sorts of upsets could
    happen. By using machine learning techniques, such as neural networks and random forests, we hope to find what causes a team to push
    through a tournament and win it all.</p>
  <br>
  <h3 class="main">Dataset</h3>
  <p>The dataset was acquired from Kaggle's 2019 March Madness competition. The dataset had recorded games from 1985-current and included
    regular season as well as tournament games, totaling to over 88000 games. The dataset included 14 features such as free throws made,
    steals, and offensive rebounds. For each game, the stats for each of those features was recorded and used in our analysis. Fortunately,
    most the data was already quantified so we did not have to do it ourselves. The only data we had to quantify was the location of the game.
    We did this by having -1 represent an away game, 0 a neutral game, and 1 a home game.</p>
  <h3 class="dataset-header">Our models used the following features for each team:</h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">

  <br>
  <h3 class="main">Approach</h3>
  <p>We evaluated all the games using different subsets of features. We grouped features based on related statistics. For example, feature set 3
      contains primarily defensive statistics such as defensive rebounds, steals, blocks, and fouls. We used sets of features that we thought would
      perform the best and compared the results against other sets. To train our model, we gave it data for games from 1985 to 2018 and had our models
      predict the outcomes. To make our 2019 March Madness predictions, we fed our models each competing team's regular season average data coming into the
      competition. Then we had the models predict every possible matchup and generate a bracket.</p>
  <p>The different supervised learning models we used were Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks.
      Additionally, we used XGBoost as a means of increasing the accuracy of our results as well as incorporating a new feature, seeding,
      when we construct our bracket. Since we had multiple models that worked well, we decided to implement a new method which would pick the
      most confident choice out of all the models.</p>
  <p>To check the success of our models, we will have the models generate brackets and calculate the number of points that bracket would
      have earned used the 1-2-4-8-16-32 method. This method assigns 1 point for each correct prediction in the first round, 2 points for each
      correct prediction in the second round and so on with 32 points being awarded for predicting the winner of the entire competition.
      In 2018, the average bracket entered in the NCAA's official competition scored 57 out of a possible 192 points. We set a target of 100
      points for our models.</p>
  <h3 class="model-header">Logistic Regression</h3>
  <p>Logistic Regression is a discriminative model that calculates the probability of a data point being in a specific class, in this case
        the probability of a team winning or losing.

  </p>
  <h3 class="model-header">Random Forests</h3>
  <p>Random Forests is an ensemble method performed by bagging multiple random decision trees.  Bagging combines multiple decision trees
          to reduce the final variance which should improve the accuracy of the model.

  </p>
  <h3 class="model-header">Naive Bayes</h3>
  <p>Naive Bayes is a generative model working under the assumption that features are independent and classifies the data regardless of
          correlations between features.

  <h3 class="model-header">Neural Networks</h3>
  <p>Neural Networks use a multitude of different nodes that sum up a series of weights for all the features to produce an output.

  <p>
    ____Insert Neural Networks Analysis Here___
  </p>
  <h3 class="model-header">Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)</h3>
  <p>XGBoost is an ensemble learning method similar to random forests in that it uses decision trees but uses gradient boosting. Gradient
      boosting sequentially adds trained predictors and assigns them weights and updates the model it is creating using gradient descent.
      It helps to minimize both bias and variance by using a multitude of decision trees and has historically been considered one of the
      best models to use when using machine learning to generate predictions. This is due to XGBoost's build-in cross validation and it's
      use of both LASSO and Ridge regression to prevent overfitting.
    </p>
    <img src = "images/finalXGBPoints.PNG" alt = "XGB Points">
  <p>
    While our XGBoosting models were all able to perform very well in the training, they tended to perform towards the middle of the
    pack when generating a bracket for the 2019 March Madness competition. We believe this might be due to the fact that we train and test
    our model based on a mix of data from 1985 to 2019 (not including the 2019 March Madness competition). However, the way basketball has
    play was evolved over time. For example, the NCAA did not universally adopt the 3 point line until 1986 while 3 pointers are now considered
    one of the best and most important shots in basketball. So while our model did a very good job of predicting the test data, it was unable to
    account for the ways basketball has evolved when making it's predictions for the 2019 March Madness competition.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3 class="model-header">Pick Most Confident (Our own ensemble Method)</h3>
  <p>We wrote a script that would compare bracket predictions from our best models, which were logistic regression and
      neural networks. The script would compare the predictions in the two models and choose the prediction that had
      higher certainty, meaning the difference between winning rate of the two teams. The reason behind such decision was
      that the two models, logistic regression and neural networks had similar accuracy so we tested if combining the two
      models would improve our accuracy. The log loss of the model did not change much but the brackets have improved
      accuracy by an average of 2%.</p>
  <img src = "images/finalMCPoints.PNG" alt = "MC Points">
  <br>
  <h3 class="model-header">Seeding</h3>
  <p>Upsets in basketball occur when a higher seeded team loses to a much worse team. Of the 63 games played over the course of each
      tournament since 1985, there has been on average 12 upsets per tournament. Due to this, we created a higher threshold for lower
      seeded teams to win; teams that are lower seeded need to have higher than a 50% chance to win in order to move on in the bracket.</p>
  <p>Our implementation of seeding has been proven to be quite useful. Given a equal probability distribution
    (which scored 12 points for its prediction), the seeding implementation predicted a bracket that scored 76.
    That's roughly a 500% improvement! Our 5 highest scoring brackets all used seeding and there was a 5.4% increase in
    the average points of the brackets going from unseeded to seeded.</p>
    <!-- <img src = "images/mostConfidentPoints.png" alt = "Most Confident Points"> -->
  <br>
  <h3 class="main">Results</h3>
  <h3 class="model-header">Seeding</h3>
  <p>Unfortunately, the effects of seeding isn't necessarily positive and depends on
      the model it is applied to. It was observed that for ensemble methods such as XGBoosting or our Pick Most
      Confident method, the seeding had negative effects. WHY?________________. Outside of the ensemble methods, we also
      noticed a trend that the degree to the improvement in accuracy made by the seeding is affected by the initial
      accuracy of the model. WHY?____This is a result of our algorithm making a decision based on the probabilities the
      model give, which means if the model gives inaccurate probabilities, then our seeding implementation will make a
      worse decision.</p>

  <p><img src = "images/pickMostConfident.PNG" alt = "All Accuracies" class = "center"></p>
  <h3 class="model-header">Overall Results</h3>
  <p>
    We evaluated each model using the log-loss for the 2018-2019 March Madness tournament as well as how many points the bracket would
    generate in the NCAA competition. Logistic Regression, along with Neural Networks, performed the best out of the first four
    techniques and usually had a very close accuracy with Neural Networks. This is most likely the case because of the Neural Network's
    own logistic regression it uses to calculate the weights. Out of all the feature sets, Naive Bayes consistently performed the worst
    and had the worst accuracy on the training data. Most notably, the classifier was extremely confident in all of its predicted matchups,
    even though it predicted many of them incorrectly. Random Forests consistently performed worse than both Neural Networks and
    Logistic Regression but better than Naive Bayes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our 5 best brackets all scored 120 points or above which was far above the 2018 average of 57 points and in addition,
    36 of our 96 brackets reached our target and scored over 100 points. Our best bracket, using Pick Most Confident and
    Seeding for feature set 7, produced 124 points, which could be enough to win a few bets or competitions but is still
    far from the perfect score of 192. Due to the point system awarding more points in the later rounds, just predicting
    the winner grants 63 points. While our model does predict the correct winner, it would need to perform even better to
    predict the final game.
  </p>

  <h3 class="main">Future Steps</h3>
  <p>
    Our model's were trained using data that went as far back as 1985. However, the way basketball is played has changed
    drastically over time. For example, it wasn't until 1986 that the 3 point line was adopted by the NCAA. However, in the
    modern game, the 3 pointer is one of the most important (and best) shots a player can take. So while old data is definitely
    valuable, we could probably improve upon our models by having them value data from more recent seasons more than data from
    older seasons.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another way we could improve our models would be to try to take experience into account. March Madness is associated
    with a lot of excitement, close games, and stress as players are forced to deal with environments they have never been in.
    Teams that have players and coaches who have a lot of experience with March Madness are less likely to be rattled by
    immense pressure that teams face in March Madness. We believe that by incorporating this factor we can improve the
    accuracy of our models.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another way we could improve upon our model is by trying to increase it's ability to predict upsets. We could try to do this
    by further tinkering with our seeding factor. However, upsets are still fairly hard to predict. Some teams could choke or have important players
    get injured which would end their tournament run. Using extra features such as player experience or tendency to under
    perform may help in predicting those upsets.
  </p>
  <p>
      An additional ML technique we could use is Node Regression. Node Regression slightly modifies Logistic Regression and uses it in the training of Neural Networks.
  </p>
    <!--Logistic Regression but better than Naïve Bayes. Our seeding implementation was effective
    but only had a positive impact when using it in combination with one model and the degree of its impact on the
    prediction of the bracket was dependent on the accuracy of the model it was used in combination with.</p>-->
